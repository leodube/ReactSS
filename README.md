# React-SS
**React Simple Setup** is the react boilerplate I use for most of my projects. This minimal setup handles installation of react, webpack, babel, and bootstrap dependencies.

## Usage
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/leodube/react-ss.git <PROJECT_NAME>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
rm -rf .git .gitignore
npm install
npm start
```
Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and `npm`.

### Built with:
- React
- Webpack
- Babel
- Bootstrap
